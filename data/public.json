Sqrt Decomposition is a method (or a data structure) that allows you to perform some common operations (finding sum of the elements of the sub-array, finding the minimal/maximal element, etc.) in O(\u221an) operations, which is much faster than O(n) for the trivial algorithm.\r\n\r\ntl,dr: Square root decomposition speeds up your program by a fair bit.",
